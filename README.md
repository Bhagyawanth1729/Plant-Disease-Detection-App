# Plant-Disease-Detection-App
# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection App

This project is an Android-based mobile application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect plant leaf diseases from images. The app provides real-time disease classification and suggests treatment solutions to help farmers take immediate action. It works offline using a TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) model for fast, on-device inference.
